                    <h3>Not Black Magic!</h3>
                    <p>With the correct tools and knowledge waxing your skis is not an intimidating or complicated process.  There are two types of waxes - kick wax and glide wax.  The tips and tails of classic skis and the entire base of skating skis must be glide waxed.  The grip area of Classic skis either needs to be waxed with grip wax or it might have a ‘no wax area’ such as scales which are treated differently depending on grip area.   You just need to match the weather forecast, temperature of the snow with the type of waxes you have around.

                     </p>

                    <h3>What is the process?</h3>
                    <p>You can either go to a retail xc shop and get them waxed professionally or do it yourself.  If you are a keen skier it is worth learning how to do it yourself. Look out for waxing courses or talk to a ski shop and they might teach you how to wax your skis.  
                        <p>At the most basic level all you need is some rub on wax which are simply rubbed on and polished with a metal brush or scourer.  The negative is that these are not as durable as iron on waxes but are easy to apply.
                        <p>To use iron on waxes you need to invest in a waxing iron, metal brush, plexiglass scraper, groom pen and some wax.  To get a much better job you can also purchase a wax bench or use a vise and a polishing brush.  The ski gets held in place which makes the application and removal of waxes far easier.

                    <h3>Glide Wax</h3>
                    <p>There are an amazing array of products for glide waxing (and kick waxing too).  There are sprays, blocks, powders etc out there but for a beginner/intermediate skier blocks of plain old glide wax are sufficient.  
                        <p>There are two factors you need to consider; temperature range and percentage of fluorocarbons.  Glide waxes are rated by temperature of the snow and by % of fluorocarbons which generally make the ski faster but come with increased health,  environmental risks and cost.  Generally if you are skiing in the same location you will use the same wax 80% of the time and use a ‘no fluoro’ or ‘low fluoro’ (LF) glide wax.  
                        <p>You can get really technical about ski waxing, but it does not have to be complicated and if you regularly just wax your skis they will work very well.

                    <h3>No Wax Skis</h3>
                    <p>No wax skis that have a pattern that act as the grip section of a classic ski.  Only classic skis have this grip section where you do not need to apply glide wax to.  Snow can build up on this area at some temperatures/snow conditions and you may need to use a Grip/Glide wax to stop this.

                    <h3>Kick Wax</h3>
                    <p>Kick/grip wax is used when you are classic skiing with waxable skis.  There are two types of kick wax; klister and hard wax.  Klister has the consistency of honey and hard wax comes is small hard blocks.   Klister is used on old snow that has melted and refrozen and hard waxes are used in new snow.  Grip waxes, like glide waxes, are rated on snow temperature and condition.  
                        <p>Klister is not hard to apply just a little sticky.  Just heat the tube up before applying to soften it up and carefully apply it about 1 mm thick throughout the kick zone (1 to 1.5 of your foot in front of the toe to the back of the heel).  Smooth the klister out with a finger or a scraper.  To remove the klister just use a base cleaner and wipe it off.
                        <p>Hard wax must be rubbed onto the kick zone and then rubbed with a cork on the wax to heat it up, smooth it and make it more pliable.  Repeat for around two to three layers.  To remove hard wax just scrape it off with a scraper.

                <h3>Some tips on how to wax your skis</h3>
             
                           <p align=left>&#8226; Always brush and polish with even strokes from the tip to the tail of the ski
                           <br>&#8226; The most important brush is the metal one.
                           <br>&#8226; Brushing makes the ski glide faster and the bases will stay cleaner for longer
                           <br>&#8226; You can just even just use a kitchen scourer to polish rub on wax
                                <br>&#8226; Set the waxing iron to the correct temperature noted on the wax package
                                <br>&#8226; If a finger cannot be held onto the base of the ski immediately after running the iron over it , the irons needs to be moved faster or turned down
                                <br>&#8226; There are no magic number of brush strokes you need to use once you have scraped your ski down - just that the base is shiny and smooth
