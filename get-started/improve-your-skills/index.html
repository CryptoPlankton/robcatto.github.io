                    <p class="left__aligned--p">Many schoolyard games can be played on skis.  Most are best played without poles, and can be done on skating or classic skis.  All you need is a wide, relatively flat area of snow.  The aim of all these games is to promote confidence and mobility on the snow. Make up some new games of your own that involve plenty of skiing and changes of direction.
                        <h3 class="heading__aligned--page">Touch</h3>
                        <p class="left__aligned--p left__sub--para">Play the same as for touch on the grass. Use a plastic drink bottle if a ball is not available.

                        <p class="left__aligned--p left__sub--para">Mark two lines on the snow about 40m apart. The fox stands in the middle and the geese line up one one side. When the fox calls ‘Go’, the geese try to make it across to the other line without being tagged. Once tagged, the geese join the fox and the game continues until all are caught.
                        <h3 class="heading__aligned--page">Scarecrow Tiggy</h3>
                        <p class="left__aligned--p left__sub--para">Mark an area on the snow to indicate playing boundaries. One person is ‘It’ and must try to tag the others with one hand to the body.  Anyone caught must stand with their legs in a V until someone else frees them by crawling through the legs.

For most of these, all you need is a flat section of track or a wide area in which to work without disrupting other skiers.

                        <p class="left__aligned--p left__sub--para">Find some downhill corners on the track and practice skiing around them. Try to keep your centre of gravity low and take small steps.

                        <p class="left__aligned--p left__sub--para">Double pole or skate to build momentum on a long gentle slope. Lift one ski off the snow and hold it for as long as you can. As a variation, try hopping up and down on one leg while gliding.
