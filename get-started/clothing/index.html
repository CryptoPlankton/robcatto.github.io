                <h3>The difference between an enjoyable day of skiing and a cold one</h3>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">
                   Your clothing has a big impact on your XC skiing experience so it is worth taking the time to get it right.  A beautiful sunny day can change quickly into a cold, snowy blizzard so it is important to be prepared. It's not necessary to buy the latest and greatest clothing, however a little bit of planning and layering can make a big difference.

                 <section class="mobile_section">
                <h3>Layering</h3>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">Layers work best for xc skiing as you can put layers on or take them off as you need to. If you overheat and sweat too much you will then get cold quickly when you stop. If the wind picks up or wet snow starts to fall a wind-proof or water-proof layer is very handy. It's very common for xc skiers to head out with a couple of layers to start off with and an extra insulating or weather proofing layer or two in a backpack just in case.
                 <h3 align=left>Upper body layers</h3>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">First layer should be  out of synthetic material or wool (not cotton) as it wicks away moisture and keeps you dry.  
                <p class="left__aligned--p">Mid layer can be a wool or synthetic jumper or fleece, or tracksuit or long-sleeve cycling tops.
                <p class="left__aligned--p">Outer layer consists of a wind-proof or water-proof jacket (generally uninsulated in Australia) 
                <h3 align=left>Lower body layers</h3>
                <p class="left__aligned--p"> First layer can be a set of thermal pants or tights, or even both
                <p class="left__aligned--p"> The next layer can be a set of tracksuit pants, thicker tights or other leggings, or cross country ski specific warm-up pants. Not jeans, as they get wet quickly and stay wet.
                <p class="left__aligned--p"> A final outer layer of waterproof overpants for extra warmth, wind and rain/snow protection. You may not need this, but it's to bring them in your car or back-pack just in case.
                </p>
                      <h3 align=left>What about alpine skiing jackets & pants?</h3>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">If you plan to spend time standing around or playing with kids in the snow, then the thick insulated jackets/pants generall used for alpine skiing can be a good option. However, these are not such a practical if you are skiing a lot yourself, as they don't give you the option to layer up or down if needed.

                    <h3>Headgear</h3>
                  
                   <p class="left__aligned--p">Beanies, headbands. Most XC skiers ski with a beanie. Many skiers use ones in the style of a headband to protect the ears from the cold but regulate how hot you get.
                   <p class="left__aligned--p">Something extra here about buffs. And maybe a link.

                    <h3>Eyewear</h3>
                       <p class="left__aligned--p">A good pair of sunglasses is necessary to protect your eyes.  Sometimes in snowy windy conditions it is better to use goggles or protective visor.

                    <h3>Gloves</h3>
                       <p class="left__aligned--p">Gloves are an integral part of your clothing and are generally less insulated than gloves for downhill skiing and not waterproof.  When you are exercising you do not need anything more than a fleece or woollen glove.  Again there are many quality gloves that are in the shops which will do an even better job if you get keen on xc skiing as a sport.  If you are planning to do snow play it might be wise to include a pair of waterproof gloves otherwise your gloves will get wet and your hands cold.  When skiing with kids it is always wise to have a spare pair of gloves.
