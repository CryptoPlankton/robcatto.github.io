                <h3>The difference between an enjoyable day of skiing and a cold one</h3>
                <p>
                   Your clothing will have a big impact on how well you enjoy your XC skiing experience so it is worth taking the time to get it right.  A beautiful sunny day can change quickly into a cold, snowy blizzard to your clothing must be versatile and you should have access to protective layers.

                <h3>Use insulating layers</h3>
                <p>Layers work best for xc skiing as you do not want to get too hot and sweaty, as you will get cold quickly when you stop.  You are better to start cooler and take an extra insulating layer or two in a backpack to put on when you stop.
                <p>First layer should be  out of synthetic material or wool (not cotton) as it wicks away moisture and keeps you a lot more comfortable.  
                <p>Mid layer can be a wool or synthetic jumper or fleece.  
                <p>Outer layer consists of a waterproof jacket (generally uninsulated in Australia) 
                <p>Cross Country Ski Pants - A pair of synthetic tracksuit pants, leggings or even just thermals are suitable to wear xc skiing.  For extra warmth and wind protection add a pair of waterproof overpants.  If you get keen on cross country skiing a pair of cross country ski pants specifically designed for xc skiing is a good idea.

                    <h3>What accessories should I use?</h3>
                    <p>Helmet/Beanie
                   <p>Most XC skiers ski with a beanie but some kids may use a helmet. Many skiers use ones in the style of a headband to protect the ears from the cold but regulate how hot you get. 
                     <p>Sunglasses
                       <p>A good pair of sunglasses is necessary to protect your eyes.  Sometimes in snowy windy conditions it is better to use goggles or protective visor.
                        <p>Gloves
                       <p>Gloves are an integral part of your clothing and are generally less insulated than gloves for downhill skiing and not waterproof.  When you are exercising you do not need anything more than a fleece or woollen glove.  Again there are many quality gloves that are in the shops which will do an even better job if you get keen on xc skiing as a sport.  If you are planning to do snow play it might be wise to include a pair of waterproof gloves otherwise your gloves will get wet and your hands cold.  When skiing with kids it is always wise to have a spare pair of gloves.
