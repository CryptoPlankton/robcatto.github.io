                <h3>How to get to the snow</h3>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">Self drive, coach services, private transfers are just some of the ways you can get to Australian XC Resorts. Perisher is the only resort with train access (via the ski tube - link?), but first you have to drive to the ski tube terminal. Check out each resorts individual websites for more details.
                
<p class="left__aligned--p">Most people travel to Australian ski resorts by car. Some of the things to consider include resort entry fees, whether or not you need snow chains, roof racks or a roof box (see below). It is also very important to adjust your speed to the weather and road conditions.

                <h3>Resort entry</h3>
             
                   <p class="left__aligned--p">Almost all Australian ski resorts are either in national parks or within alpine resorts where a resort entry fee is required. These fees go towards clearing and maintaining the roads during the winter and other resort amenities. If travelling by bus, the resort entry fee is usually included in the ticket price. For regular visitors a season pass is well worthwhile. A Kosciuszko National Parks (link) pass covers you for Perisher and Thredbo, while a Victorian All Resorts (link) pass covers entry for Falls Creek, Mt Hotham, Lake Moutnain, Mt Buller and

                 <h3>Travelling by car</h3>
             
                   <p class="left__aligned--p">Most people travel to Australian ski resorts by car. Some of the things to consider include resort entry fees, whether or not you need snow chains, roof racks or a roof box (see below). It is also important to be prepared when driving in the snow and adjust your speed to the weather and road conditions.
                </p>
               <h3>Snow Chains</h3>
             
                   <p class="left__aligned--p">Most (all?) ski resorts in Australia require you to have snow chains for your car and to fit them where directed. At some resorts snow chains are not required for 4-wheel drives (see below). Chains can be hired at most ski rental shops in the towns approaching the resorts (eg Cooma/Jindabyne for Perisher, Mt Beauty for Falls Creek, Marysville for Lake Mountain etc.).   Diamond pattern chains are recommended.
                </p>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">If you haven't put snow chains on before seek advice from where you hire/buy them, and it's even worth having a practice putting them on and taking them off so you're not doing it for the first time in a blizzard. When going downhill chains should go on the front wheels. After driving a short way stop and tighten your chains. Put them on properly as a set of chains wrapped around the wheel hub is not much fun.
                </p>
                  <h3>4-Wheel Drives</h3>
                   <p class="left__aligned--p">For regular drivers to the Australia's ski resorts have 4-wheel drives, which in most conditions and at most resorts will save you having to put on chains. At Falls Creek and Mt Hotham it is still necessary to carry chains even if you have a 4-wheel drive, and on very snowy/slippery days you may be directed to put them on. 
                </p>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">Important! 4-wheel drives do not make your invincible. 
                </p>
                   <h3>4-Winter Tyres</h3>
                   <p class="left__aligned--p">Winter tyres have softer rubber and a different tread pattern designed for better grip when driving on snow. These are really only recommended if you are regularly driving up the snow. Normal tyres with good tread are fine for most conditions. Just check that the tread is not too worn, as driving in snowing conditions with slick tyres is very dangerous!
                </p>
                
                  <h3>Ski/roof racks and Ski boxes</h3>
                   <p class="left__aligned--p">Something about roof racks Generally "ski racks" are designed for alpine skis, not cross country skis, just regular roof racks are all that you need. The easiest is to put all your skis and poles in a ski bag and tie them on using rope or rood straps (safer than octopus straps).
                </p>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">A ski box is an alternative for roof racks, no ties are required and it's quick and easy to put skis and poles or a ski bag inside. Just make sure it's big enough to fit your skis before buying one. Link for Thule or other.

                <h3>Parking</h3>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">Tips including park as directed, turn off your windscreen wipers when you stop your car as starting up with frozen windscreen wipers is a recipe for disaster, don't drive with snow on your roof (unsecured load), bring a windscreen scraper (tape casettes will do in a pinch but proper scrapers are more effective), defrost your windscreen before driving, don't drive in ski boots.
                 </p>
                <p class="left__aligned--p"> For Perisher visitors, don't forget there's no overnight parking at the resort, only day parking. If staying overnight you'll need to do a car shuttle or take the ski tube (link).

                <h3>Travelling by bus</h3>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">Travelling via bus saves you the hassle of driving in the snow, putting on chains, scaping your windscreen and digging out your car. There are direct bus transfers from airports including Sydney, Canberra, Albury and Melbourne.

                <p class="left__aligned--p"> Add the major bus link for each resort.
