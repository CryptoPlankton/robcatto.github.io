                <h3>How to get to the snow</h3>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">Self drive, coach services, private transfers are just some of the ways you can get to Australian XC Resorts. <a href="http://www.perisher.com.au/" target=“_blank">Perisher</a> is the only resort with train access, but first you have to drive to the ski tube terminal. Check out each <a href="/getting-started/resorts/">resorts individual websites</a> for more details.

                <h3>Resort entry</h3>
             
                   <p class="left__aligned--p">Almost all Australian ski resorts are either in national parks or within alpine resorts where a resort entry fee is required. These fees go towards clearing and maintaining the roads during the winter and other resort amenities. If travelling by bus, the resort entry fee is usually included in the ticket price. For regular visitors a season pass is worth considering. A <a href="http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/passes-and-fees/annual-passes" target=“_blank">Kosciuszko National Parks</a> pass covers you for Perisher and Thredbo, while a <a href="http://www.fallscreek.com.au/SeasonPermit" target=“_blank"> Victorian All Resorts </a> pass covers entry for Falls Creek, Mt Hotham, Mt Buller, Mt Baw Baw, Mt Stirling and Lake Mountain.

                 <h3>Travelling by car</h3>
             
                   <p class="left__aligned--p">Most people travel to Australian ski resorts by car. Some of the things to consider include resort entry fees, whether or not you need snow chains, roof racks or a roof box (see below). It is also important to be prepared when driving in the snow and adjust your speed to the weather and road conditions.
                </p>
               <h3>Snow Chains</h3>
             
                   <p class="left__aligned--p">Ski resorts in Australia generally require you to have snow chains for your car and to fit them where directed. At some resorts snow chains are not required for 4-wheel drives. Check on the relevant <a href="/getting-started/resorts">resorts website</a> for more details. Chains can be hired at most ski rental shops in the towns approaching the resorts (eg Cooma/Jindabyne for Perisher, Mt Beauty for Falls Creek, Marysville for Lake Mountain etc.).   Diamond pattern chains are recommended.
                </p>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">If you haven't put snow chains on before seek advice from where you hire/buy them, and it's even worth having a practice putting them on and taking them off so you're not doing it for the first time in a blizzard. After driving a short way stop, check and you may need to tighten your chains.
                </p>
                
                  <h3>Ski/roof racks and Ski boxes</h3>
                   <p class="left__aligned--p">Generally "ski racks" are designed for alpine skis, not cross country skis, just regular roof racks are all that you need. The easiest is to put all your skis and poles in a ski bag and tie them securely on.
                </p>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">A roof box is an alternative for roof racks, no ties are required and it's quick and easy to put skis and poles or a ski bag inside. Just make sure it's big enough to fit your skis before buying one.  
                </p>
        
                <h3>Parking</h3>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">Park as directed and turn off your windscreen wipers when you stop your car as starting up with frozen windscreen wipers is a recipe for disaster.  When leaving don't drive with snow on your roof (unsecured load), bring a windscreen scraper, and defrost your windscreen before driving.
                 </p>
                <p class="left__aligned--p"> For Perisher visitors, don't forget there's no overnight parking at the resort, only day parking. If staying overnight you'll need to do a car shuttle or take the ski tube.
                 </p>

                <h3>Travelling by bus</h3>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">Travelling via bus saves you the hassle of driving in the snow, putting on chains, scaping your windscreen and digging out your car. There are direct bus transfers from airports including Sydney, Canberra, Albury and Melbourne.
                 </p>
                <p class="left__aligned--p"> Bus service to the major xc resorts include; <a href="http://www.fallscreekcoachservice.com.au" target=“_blank">Falls Creek Coach Service</a> and <a href="http://www.FallsBus.com.au" target=“_blank">FallsBus</a> to Falls Creek.  <a href="http://www.lakemountainsnowbus.com" target=“_blank">Lake Mountain Snow Bus</a> service to Lake Mountain and check out the various options to Perisher on their <a href="http://www.perisher.com.au/plan-your-trip/new-to-perisher/getting-here" target=“_blank">website</a>.
