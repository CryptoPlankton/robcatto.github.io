                <h3>How to get to the resorts?</h3>
                <p>Self drive, coach services, private transfers are just some of the ways you can get to Australian XC Resorts.  Check out each resorts individual websites for more details.
                   <p>Most people travel to Australian XC resorts by car.  Some of the things to consider include; most resorts have entry fees for vehicles onto the mountain, resorts require you to have snow chains for your car and require you to fit them where directed.  These can be hired at most ski rental shops. It is also important to be prepared when driving in the snow and adjust your speed to the weather and road conditions.
