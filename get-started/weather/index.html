                <p>
                   Mountain weather can be extremely unpredictable and skiers are advised to be prepared for all conditions and check weather forecasts before setting out.  It will allow you to choose the correct clothing, decide which skis to take and decide where you should ski that day.  Also it is best to try and choose a clear sunny day for your first xc skiing experience.
