                <p>
                   Mountain weather can be extremely unpredictable and skiers are advised to be prepared for all conditions and check weather forecasts before setting out.  It will allow you to choose the correct clothing, decide which skis to take and decide where you should ski that day.  Also it is best to try and choose a clear sunny day for your first xc skiing experience.

                 websites will give you the best information on the local snow conditions and details of trails groomed, though sometimes they can be a tad optimistic or slow to be updated. <a href="http://www.perisherxcountry.org/index.php"target="blank">Perisher XC</a> has great daily email report you can sign up for that gives fresh information early every morning. Twitter, Instagram and Facebook can also be good ways to find out the latest information and tips of where/where not to ski. </p>
