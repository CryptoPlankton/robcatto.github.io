                    <h3>Skis</h3>
                    <p class="left__aligned--p">In general cross country skis are thinner and lighter than downhill skis.  For track skiing there are two main types of skis; classic skis with a pattern/wax underneath the foot which stops it from gliding backwards, and skate skis which are completely smooth on the bottom and designed only for gliding. For both classic and skating skis probably the most important thing is that they are the right stiffness (or flex) for your weight.
                <h3 align=left>Classic skis</h3>
                    <p align=left>Classic skis come in two varieties: waxable and waxless. Waxable skis need grip wax applied to the bottom middle section in order to get grip. Waxless skis don’t need grip wax, the most common of these have a patterned section on the bottom that pushes down into the snow to get grip. This form of waxless skis are called fishscales, step skis or similar (derived from the pattern on the bottom).
                    <p align=left>Micro-base skis or "zeros" are another form of waxless ski, these have a roughened section of base instead of a pattern. Micro-base skis are often good for Australian conditions/fresh snow and near zero temperatures, however they don't work so well if the snow is too cold or is icy. For the more advanced its possible to apply grip wax over the top of the micro-base skis when they are not working, however for the general public not planning to wax patterned skis are recommended.
                        <p align=left>Waxable skis are usually faster than all forms of waxless skis, however, getting the rigth wax is an art, particularly in Australia where conditions often change continuously throughout the day. Wax too warm and the skis will stick too much and won't glide; too cold and they won't grip. It's a different story in parts of Europe where conditions are usually more stable. The general tip: leave grip waxing to the serious racers, and if you want to learn to wax seek advice from a local expert. This <a href="http://crosscountryskier.com.au/techniques/classic/2007104186094.htm"target="blank">link</a> gives an example of what racing with waxable skis can entiail.</p>
                        
                   <h3 align=left>Skate skis</h3>
                    <p align=left>Skate skis are slightly shorter and stiffer than classic skis, and have a more rounded tip. The entire base of a skate ski is smooth, designed only for optimal glide. Similar to classic skis, skate skis are designed to fit the skier’s weight and height. Skis that are too stiff will dig into the snow at the tip and tails, while soft skis can bottom out when pushing off. For skating skis having a good edge is more important than for classic skis, particular in hard-packed or icy conditions.
                     </p>
               <h3 align=left>Touring skis</h3>
              <p align=left>Cross country touring skis are fatter and heavier than track skis. Some have metal edges, which are handy for tackling any icy conditions. The prime factor in selecting touring skis is that they are stable, as most of the time they will be used on ungroomed and variable snow.
              <h3 align=left>Telemark skis</h3>
              <p align=left>Forget all the generalisations above about cross country skis being thinner and lighter than downhill skis. Serious telemarkers want fat skis with a capital PH and side-cut to boot. Of course there's a spectrum, depending on the conditions the skis are likely to be used in, and whether the skier will be using a chair-lift or their own steam to get to the top of the hills.

                         <h3>Boots</h3>
                    <p align=left>XC boots are quite similar to running shoes in comfort. Skating boots are higher cut than classic boots and hence have more ankle support. They are also stiffer. 'Combi' boots can be a good way of saving money when you first get into the sport, particularly for kids who might start to race in both classic and skating races.

                    <h3>Different types of binding systems</h3>
                    <p>All you need to cross country ski are skis, boots and poles.  You will also need to understand there are various types of skis depending on what you want do and where you want to go and different types of binding systems for boots to skis.
                                
                                <br>SNS - Brands include Salomon, Atomic and Oneway
                                <br>NNN - Brands include Fischer, Madhus, Alpina and Rossignal
                        <p>There are different bindings, boot and ski combination for e.g. backcountry that cannot be used on lightweight race skis.
                        <p>Also there are are manual bindings and automatic bindings.  Manual bindings tend to be easier to attach and detach.

                    <h3>Pole lengths differ</h3>
                    <p>Poles are thin and light, with a basket on the bottom to stop the pole from going deep into the snow.  There are different pole lengths for classic and skate.  Classic pole length is around minus 20cm of height and skate are around minus 10 cm.  There are also racing straps which act like a sling that cradles your hand or there are poles for beginners with a loop.  The price you pay for poles reflects the material they are made from.
