                    <h3>What are the different types of skis?</h3>
                    <p>Cross country skis are thinner and much lighter than downhill skis, and are easy to manoeuvre.  There are two types of skis; classic skis with a pattern/wax underneath the foot which stops it gliding backwards and provides grip or skate skis which are shorter and completely smooth on the bottom.  There are combi skis which can be used for both but it is better to use either a skate or classic skis (combi boots work well though). And finally there are skis for kids under 65kg and these are usually cheaper than the adult ones.
                <h3>All about classic skis</h3>
                    <p>AClassic skis come in two varieties: waxable and waxless.  Waxable skis need 2 kinds of wax: kick or grip wax and glide wax. Waxless skis don’t need kick wax, but they do need glide wax. 
                        <p>What kind of Waxless skis can you get  -
                        <br>Fish scales - the most common waxless ski for beginners only need to glide wax tips and tails
                        <br>Zeros - good for australian conditions/fresh snow and near zero temperatures - by sanding the kick zone gives you grip and anti icing spray stops them icing up.  Good as a secondary ski alongside a waxable ski.
                        <br>Carpet skis - a more reliable version of zeros for a wider range of temperatures but are often slower.

                        <p>On well groomed trails, wide heavy skis are more difficult to handle than lighter, skinny skis. The opposite is true in ungroomed snow. Classic skis are fit to the skier’s weight and height. Of the two factors, weight is most important.
                        <p>In general, people who are serious about cross-country skiing ski on waxable skis. That’s because kick wax almost always gives superior performance over the various grip materials used on waxless skis.
                        <p>Difference between cross country skis and touring skis are metal edges.
                   <h3>All about skate skis</h3>
                    <p>Skate skiing is generally done on hard packed or groomed snow. Although you can also use them with a little fresh snow over groomed trails but it is harder work. The entire base of a skate ski is smooth and should be regularly glide waxed.  Skate skis are fit to the skier’s weight and height. They are usually shorter and stiffer than classic skis.

                    <h3>Kinds of binding systems</h3>
                    <p>All you need to cross country ski are skis, boots and poles.  You will also need to understand there are various types of skis depending on what you want do and where you want to go and different types of binding systems for boots to skis.

                        <p>There are different bindings, boot and ski combination for e.g. backcountry that cannot be used on lightweight race skis.
                        <p>Also there are are manual bindings and automatic bindings.  Manual bindings tend to be easier to attach and detach.

                    <h3>What kind of boots</h3>
                    <p>XC Boots are quite similar to running shoes in comfort but with lots of ankle support.  There are Skate boots, Classic boots and Combi boots. Skate boots fit are usually a little tighter fitting than classic boots, A ‘combi’ boot is a way of saving money when you first get into the sport.  Also it can be a good one to fit kids out in.

                    <h3>What kinds of poles?</h3>
                    <p>Poles are thin and light, with a basket on the bottom to stop the pole from going deep into the snow.  There are different pole lengths for classic and skate.  Classic pole length is around minus 20cm of height and skate are around minus 10 cm.  There are also racing straps which act like a sling that cradles your hand or there are poles for beginners with a loop.  The price you pay for poles reflects the material they are made from.
