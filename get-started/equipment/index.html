You may also need different types of skis, boots and poles depending on what you want do and where you want to go. Read on!

                    <h3>Skis</h3>
                    <p class="left__aligned--p">In general cross country skis are thinner and lighter than downhill skis.  For track skiing there are two main types of skis; classic skis with a pattern/wax underneath the foot which stops it from gliding backwards, and skate skis which are completely smooth on the bottom and designed only for gliding. For both classic and skating skis probably the most important thing is that they are the right stiffness (or flex) for your weight.
                <h3 align=left>Classic skis</h3>
                    <p align=left>Classic skis come in two varieties: waxable and waxless. Waxable skis need grip wax applied to the bottom middle section in order to get grip. Waxless skis don’t need grip wax, the most common of these have a patterned section on the bottom that pushes down into the snow to get grip. This form of waxless skis are called fishscales, step skis or similar (derived from the pattern on the bottom).
                    <p align=left>Micro-base skis or "zeros" are another form of waxless ski, these have a roughened section of base instead of a pattern. Micro-base skis are often good for Australian conditions/fresh snow and near zero temperatures, however they don't work so well if the snow is too cold or is icy. For the more advanced its possible to apply grip wax over the top of the micro-base skis when they are not working, however for the general public not planning to wax patterned skis are recommended.
                    <p align=left>On well groomed trails, wide heavy skis are more difficult to handle than lighter, skinny skis. The opposite is true in ungroomed snow. Classic skis are fit to the skier’s weight and height. Of the two factors, weight is most important.
                        <p align=left>In general, people who are serious about cross-country skiing ski on waxable skis. That’s because kick wax almost always gives superior performance over the various grip materials used on waxless skis.
                        <p align=left>Difference between cross country skis and touring skis are metal edges.
                   <h3 align=left>All about skate skis</h3>
                    <p align=left>Skate skiing is generally done on hard packed or groomed snow. Although you can also use them with a little fresh snow over groomed trails but it is harder work. The entire base of a skate ski is smooth and should be regularly glide waxed.  Skate skis are designed to fit the skier’s weight and height. They are usually shorter and stiffer than classic skis.

                    <h3>Different types of binding systems</h3>
                    <p>All you need to cross country ski are skis, boots and poles.  You will also need to understand there are various types of skis depending on what you want do and where you want to go and different types of binding systems for boots to skis.
                                
                                <br>SNS - Brands include Salomon, Atomic and Oneway
                                <br>NNN - Brands include Fischer, Madhus, Alpina and Rossignal
                        <p>There are different bindings, boot and ski combination for e.g. backcountry that cannot be used on lightweight race skis.
                        <p>Also there are are manual bindings and automatic bindings.  Manual bindings tend to be easier to attach and detach.

                    <h3>XC boots are comfortable</h3>
                    <p>XC Boots are quite similar to running shoes in comfort but with lots of ankle support.  There are Skate boots, Classic boots and Combi boots. Skate boots fit are usually a little tighter fitting than classic boots, A ‘combi’ boot is a way of saving money when you first get into the sport.  Also it can be a good one to fit kids out in.

                    <h3>Pole lengths differ</h3>
                    <p>Poles are thin and light, with a basket on the bottom to stop the pole from going deep into the snow.  There are different pole lengths for classic and skate.  Classic pole length is around minus 20cm of height and skate are around minus 10 cm.  There are also racing straps which act like a sling that cradles your hand or there are poles for beginners with a loop.  The price you pay for poles reflects the material they are made from.
