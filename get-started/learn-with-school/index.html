                <p>Many schools run cross country ski programs as part of their sports or outdoor education programs.  Please ask your school whether they organise any ski trips, participate in cross country Interschools or take part in other skiing events.

                    <h3>How can my school get into XC?</h3>
                    <p>If your school doesn't have a program yet, let your teachers know that there are number of outdoor education centres that run cross country skiing experiences and plenty of <a href="http://discoverxcski.com/get-started/find-a-xc-ski-school/"target="blank">resort ski schools</a> that can assist to get things started. Finding a teacher with personal XC skiing experience can greatly assist getting a program off the ground. The <a href="http://nswinterschools.com.au/about-interschools"target="blank">NSW Interschools</a> and <a href="http://www.vicinterschools.com.au/"target="blank">VIC Interschools</a> organisations are also happy to give schools guidance on how to become involved in Interschools XC.

                <h3>Not just a winter sport</h3>
                <p>
                    Cross country skiing is not just limited to the winter months.  Training can be extended through the summer months using rollerskis or skikes.  There are various summer events that run by clubs and resorts that are great fun to participate in as a school or individual.
