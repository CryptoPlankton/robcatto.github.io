                <h3>Does your school already participate in Interschools?</h3>
                <p>Many schools run cross country ski programs as part of their sports or outdoor education programs.  Please ask your school whether they  
participate in cross country Interschools.
                <p>Cross country skiing at school level is not just limited to Interschools there are many other events that schools or individuals are most welcome to join in.  A great way to meet other keen skiers and make new friends!  Check out the events calendar for more details.

                    <p>If you are keen to get into XC, let your schools know that there are facilities such as outdoor education centres that run cross country skiing experiences.   <a href="http://www.skiandsnowboard.org.au/"target="blank">Ski and Snowboard Australia</a> are also a great resource and are happy give schools guidance on how to join the cross country skiing community.  Also talk to Interschools Australia on how to get involved in the XC events at Interschools.

                <h3>Not just a winter sport</h3>
                <p>
                    Cross country skiing is not just limited to the winter months.  Training can be extended through the summer months using rollerskis or skikes.  There are various summer events that run by clubs and resorts that are great fun to participate in as a school or individual.
