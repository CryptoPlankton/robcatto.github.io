                <h3>The closest thing to xc</h3>
                <p>Rollerskiing is an off-snow equivalent to cross country skiing - cross country skiing on wheels. It is a great year round activity for maintaining fitness, working on technique, or even learning to ski before the winter.

                    <h3>Work on your technique with no snow</h3>
                    <p>As with snow XC skis, rollerskis can be classic, skate or combi, and just about all techniques used on snow can be used while rollerskiing. All you need is smooth road or bike path and preferably no traffic (see suggested locations below). Asphalt or bitumen is best, not concrete as the surface is too hard for the pole tips to dig in. 
                    <p>Rollerski wheels are generally solid rubber, though some pneumatic wheels are available. Normal ski poles can be used, though it’s usually best to replace the pole tips with specific rollerski tips as they are much more durable.

                <h3>How to learn to rollerski</h3>
                <p>
                    It is recommended to start rollerskiing with a lesson from someone who knows what they are talking about. Getting in touch with a qualified XC skiing coach or instructor is a good way to start and a must for any school group. Some of the winter XC Ski Schools may be able to assist.
                <p>Check out these tips (sourced from the Level 0 rollerskiing coaching course) on how to learn to rollerski.  Want to know more about rollerskiing technique look out for rollerski courses on AUSXC.com

                <h3>Where to Rollerski?</h3>
                <p>
                While rollerskiing is the closest thing to cross country skiing without snow, it’s not for everyone. Roads and bike paths are not as forgiving as snow. It’s great for training and for keeping up specific fitness over the summer, and for proficient skiers can also be great for touring cities on bike paths or even daily commuting. 
                <p>For beginners, our recommendations are to start on a closed in location with no traffic and a good surface, preferably with grass on the side, and with a qualified instructor or coach.
