                <p class="left__aligned--p">One of the most reliable snow locations in North America, Silver Star is also one of the best examples of a ski resort that successfully caters for both cross country and alpine enthusiasts. You even get to use the main chair-lift as part of your cross country ski pass! Great opportunities for ski in / ski out accommodation, and combined with <a href="http://www.sovereignlake.com" target="_blank">Sovereign Lake</a> has 105 km of interconnected trails catering for all abilities.

                <h3 class="heading__aligned--page" style="text-align: center;">Dobbiaco, Italy </h3>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">The Tyrolean village of Dobbiaco in the heart of the Italian Dolomites, is where Italy meets Austria in a curious and delightful cultural overlap – think onion-domed churches and Baroque castles, apfel strudel and 101 varieties of gelato;  fashionistas in furs rub sipping ‘piccolos’ next to nordic world champs sporting the ‘hotttest new lycra look’.
 
                <p>It’s the ultimate destination for XC skiers – over 120km of diverse ski trails, from the cruisy to the challenging and everything in between and the centre of an integrated transport (rail/bus) and trail network which opens up endless touring opportunities on the 200km of tracks in the Alta Pusteria network.
 
                <p>It has knockout scenery with the BIG WOW factor; culture in spades – hard to beat 2 beautiful languages; history steeped in world war victories and losses; and did I mention the value for money – think 2 euros for a local prosecco and 7 euros for mouthwatering Pizza or handmade fresh pasta.
 
                <p>The ‘piste’ de resistance has to be the 30km trail from Dobbiaco to Cortina. After circling the Lago di Dobbiaco/Toblacher, past the Lago di Landro/Dürrensee lake, the route will lead you into the snow-filled Valle di Landro/Höhlensteintal valley and finally to Cortina. This route offers a magnificent panorama and a beautiful view of the Tre Cime/Drei Zinnen, Monte Cristallo and Croda Rossa/Hohe Gaisl mountains. 
                <p>Dobbiaco is renowned as an international world cup competition venue. It features 120 km of perfectly groomed cross-country tracks.  Impress your ‘ski tragic’ buddies by just dropping ‘homologised slopes’ into the conversation – in ‘nordic speak’ this is very cool!  
 
                <p>Act like a pro and test your limits on the FIS-homologised slopes, or if floodlit tracks are more your thing, rug up and head out after dark, it’s a surreal experience (daily from 6 p.m. - 8 p.m.).  For the locals it’s the equivalent of us going to the gym after work or school.
