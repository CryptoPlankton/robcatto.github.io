                <p class="left__aligned--p">Where to ski once winter is over in Australia…? The list is endless!  North America and Europe are the two biggest general destinations, though Japan is also becoming popular particularly amongst the telemark skiers. If you enjoyed participating in the Kangaroo Hoppet then check out the other events on the <a href="/racing/worldloppet">Worldloppet </a> circuit. If mass participation events are not your thing, there are plenty of other locations to try out. Check out the snapshots below of some of the popular destinations amongst Australians.

                <h3 class="heading__aligned--page" style="text-align: center;">Silver Star, Canada</h3>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">One of the most reliable snow locations in North America, Silver Star is also one of the best examples of a ski resort that successfully caters for both cross country and alpine enthusiasts. You even get to use the main chair-lift as part of your cross country ski pass! Great opportunities for ski in / ski out accommodation, and combined with <a href="http://www.sovereignlake.com" target="_blank">Sovereign Lake</a> has 105 km of interconnected trails catering for all abilities.

                <h3 class="heading__aligned--page" style="text-align: center;">Dobbiaco, Italy </h3>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">The Tyrolean village of Dobbiaco in the heart of the Italian Dolomites, is where Italy meets Austria in a curious and delightful cultural overlap – think onion-domed churches and Baroque castles, apfel strudel and 101 varieties of gelato;  fashionistas in furs rub sipping ‘piccolos’ next to nordic world champs sporting the ‘hotttest new lycra look’.
 
                <p class="left__aligned--p">It’s the ultimate destination for XC skiers – over 120km of diverse ski trails, from the cruisy to the challenging and everything in between and the centre of an integrated transport (rail/bus) and trail network which opens up endless touring opportunities on the 200km of tracks in the Alta Pusteria network.
 
                <p class="left__aligned--p">It has knockout scenery with the BIG WOW factor; culture in spades – hard to beat 2 beautiful languages; history steeped in world war victories and losses; and not to mention mention the value for money – think 2 euros for a local prosecco and 7 euros for mouthwatering Pizza or handmade fresh pasta.
 
                <p class="left__aligned--p">The ‘piste’ de resistance has to be the 30km trail from Dobbiaco to Cortina. After circling the Lago di Dobbiaco/Toblacher, past the Lago di Landro/Dürrensee lake, the route will lead you into the snow-filled Valle di Landro/Höhlensteintal valley and finally to Cortina. This route offers a magnificent panorama and a beautiful view of the Tre Cime/Drei Zinnen, Monte Cristallo and Croda Rossa/Hohe Gaisl mountains.

                <h3 class="heading__aligned--page" style="text-align: center;">Oslo, Norway</h3>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">Holmenkollen in Oslo is one of the most famous xc skiing locations in the world, and certainly one of the few capital cities from which you can catch a short train ride to the tracks from the centre of the city. The crowd atmosphere during the <a href="http://skifest.no/?lang=en" target="_blank">Holmenkollen ski festival</a> (usually in March) is amazing, though if you prefer to ski without singing and dancing Norwegians all around or the smell of sausages cooking on campfires then perhaps go earlier in the year.

                <p class="left__aligned--p">Perhaps a blurb from August? Or Ronice?  I just think you need a general blurb Finn….  ask her to write. Royal Gorge resort is the largest cross country resort in the US featuring 200km of groomed trails.

                <h3 class="heading__aligned--page" style="text-align: center;">Seefeld, Austria</h3>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">The Austrians are generally much more into skating than classic though the classic skiing in Seefeld is still nice. The trails head out from the centre of town and there’s plenty of pensions, apartments and hotels within walking distance. It’s a little trek up to the Wildmoos trails but well worth the effort for the undulating trails up the top (you can also take the bus if so inclined). Host of the Winter Youth Olympic Games.

                <p class="left__aligned--p">Pull on your classic skis to head up the Dischma and Sertig valleys. Call in for a hot chocolate (or lunch) at the end of the valley, before cruising (or hurtling if so inclined) back to the main Davos valley. Go in December and you might see the Australian Ski Team training! Avoid “Blick week” at the start of December if you are not into crowds.
