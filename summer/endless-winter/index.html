                <p class="left__aligned--p">Where to ski once winter is over in Australia…? The list is endless!  North America and Europe are the two biggest general destinations, though Japan is also becoming popular particularly amongst the telemark skiers. If you enjoyed participating in the <a href="http://www.hoppet.com.au"target="_blank">Kangaroo Hoppet</a> then check out the other events on the <a href="/racing/worldloppet">Worldloppet </a> circuit. If mass participation events are not your thing, there are plenty of other locations to try out. Check out the snapshots below of some of the popular destinations amongst Australians.

                <p class="left__aligned--p">The Tyrolean village of <a href="http://www.nordicarena-toblach.it/en/home/"target="blank">Dobbiaco</a>(Italian name) or <a href="http://www.nordicarena-toblach.it/en/home/"target="blank">Toblach</a>(German name) in the heart of the Italian Dolomites, is where Italy meets Austria in a curious and delightful cultural overlap – think onion-domed churches and Baroque castles, apfel strudel and 101 varieties of gelato. It’s the ultimate destination for XC skiers – over 120km of diverse ski trails, from the cruisy to the challenging and everything in between and the centre of an integrated transport (rail/bus) and trail network which opens up endless touring opportunities on the 200km of tracks in the Alta Pusteria network. It has knockout scenery with the BIG WOW factor, 2 beautiful languages with German being the main language spoken and great value for money. The ‘piste’ de resistance has to be the 30km trail from Dobbiaco to Cortina. This route offers a magnificent panorama and beautiful views of the Tre Cime/Drei Zinnen, Monte Cristallo and Croda Rossa/Hohe Gaisl mountains.

                <p class="left__aligned--p"><a href="http://www.visitnorway.co.uk"target="blank">Holmenkollen</a> in Oslo is one of the most famous xc skiing locations in the world, and certainly one of the few capital cities from which you can catch a short train ride to the tracks from the centre of the city. The crowd atmosphere during the <a href="http://skifest.no/?lang=en" target="_blank">Holmenkollen ski festival</a> (usually in March) is amazing, though if you prefer to ski without singing and dancing Norwegians all around or the smell of sausages cooking on campfires then perhaps go earlier in the year.

                <p class="left__aligned--p">The Austrians are generally much more into skating than classic though the classic skiing in <a href="http://www.seefeld.com/en/aktivitaeten/winter/langlauf-biathlon"target="_blank">Seefeld</a> is still nice. The trails head out from the centre of town and there’s plenty of pensions, apartments and hotels within walking distance. It’s a little trek up to the Wildmoos trails but well worth the effort for the undulating trails up the top (you can also take the bus if so inclined). Host of the 2012 Winter Youth Olympic Games, Seefeld is also set to hold the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIS_Nordic_World_Ski_Championships_2019" target="_blank">2019 Nordic World Championship</a>.

Call in for a hot chocolate (or lunch) at the end of the valley, before cruising (or hurtling if so inclined) back down to the main Davos valley. In December you might see the Australian Ski Team training or competing in the annual World Cup. Avoid or target “Blick Week” at the start of December depending on whether or not you are into crowds, and say g'day the friendly crew at the local <a href="http://www.hofmaenner.com/go.cfm?english&language=de">Hofmanner</a> XC shop.
