                <p class="left__aligned--p"> DISCOVERXCSKI.com was developed with the main aim of increasing grassroots participation in cross country skiing. It is an introductory information portal for cross country skiing in Australia where you can explore the world of XC, be inspired by what it can offer and most importantly get motivated to join a growing xc community.
                <p class="left__aligned--p">It has been developed with the help of a grant from Australian Sports Foundation through the Giving 4Grassroots Fund and with the support of Ski and Snowboard Australia. It expands the reach of the current website <a href="http://ausxc.com/" target=“_blank">AUSXC.com</a>, which is primarily aimed at cross country ski racing for all levels.  Thanks to <a href="http://www.mikeedmondson.com.au" target=“_blank">Mike Edmondson</a>, <a href="http://www.fallscreekphotos.com.au" target=“_blank">Top Shots Photography</a>, <a href="http://www.hoppet.com.au" target=“_blank">Kangaroo Hoppet</a> for the use of their photos.    
               <p class="left__aligned--p">The main drivers of the project are Rob Catto-Smith, Kate Prest and Finn Marsland. We hope to see you on xc skis in the very near future!
