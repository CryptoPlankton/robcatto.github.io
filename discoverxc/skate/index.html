                <h3 class="heading__aligned--page" style="text-align: center;">If you like rollerblading you will love skating!</h3>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">Skate skiing involves pushing forward in a “V’ with your skis and pushing alternative skis away from one another at an angle, similar to rollerblading/iceskating. The skis are generally shorter than <a href="../get-started/equipment/">classic skis</a> and the <a href="../get-started/equipment/">poles</a> are longer. </p>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">There are several different skating techniques that basically depend on the terrain that you are skiing on.  These include Offset Skate, Double Time, Single Time, and Free Skate and are outlined in detail below. But basically the major difference between all the techniques is the timing of when the end of the pole hits the snow - the skating part is much the same for all techniques.

                <h3 class="heading__aligned--page" style="text-align: left;">Offset Skate</h3>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">This is the most common skating technique. As with diagonal stride, it is quite natural and best to attempt without thinking too much. Start off just tapping the poles as you skate to one side, then put more weight on your poles as you get the correct rhythm. Offset is the best technique for climbing hills. As speed increases then Double Time and Single Time techniques allow for more glide and become more efficient.

                <h3 class="heading__aligned--page" style="text-align: left;">Double Time</h3>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">For Double Time poling is done on every skate. Good balance is needed to allow time for the poles to swing back and up again while standing on one ski. A good drill for starting is to put the other ski down parallel after each skate and push.

                <h3 class="heading__aligned--page" style="text-align: left;">Single Time</h3>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">In Single Time poling is done on every second skate, with slightly different timing than for Offset skate . The pole plant should happen just before the weight is transferred to the other ski (same timing as for Double Time). The pole swing should be continuous and rhythmical, like a dance (it’s called “single dance” in Norwegian).

                <h3 class="heading__aligned--page" style="text-align: left;">Free Skate</h3>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">Free Skate is skating without using the poles.  Swinging the arms naturally helps to generate momentum and promote weight transfer.  As with all skating techniques, you should push off your inside edge, then try to glide with a flat ski.

                <p class="left__aligned--p">Basic downhill techniques are described in the classic section. The only additional skating downhill technique is the Tuck Skate, which is free skating with the arms in the tuck position.
