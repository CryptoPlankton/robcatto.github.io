                <p class="left__aligned--p">Skate skiing involves pushing forward in a “V’ Stride and pushing alternative skis away from one another at an angle, similar to rollerblading/iceskating.   The skis are generally shorter than classic and the poles are longer. The major difference between techniques is the timing of the pole plant - the skating part is much the same for all techniques.

        <section class="mobile_section" style="padding-bottom: 40px;">
                <h3 class="heading__aligned--page" style="text-align: left;">Offset Skate</h3>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">This is the most common skating technique. As with diagonal stride, it is quite natural and best to attempt without thinking too much. Start off just tapping the poles as you skate to one side, then put more weight on your poles as you get the correct rhythm. Offset is the best technique for climbing hills. As speed increases then Double Time and Single Time techniques allow for more glide and become more efficient.

                <h3 class="heading__aligned--page" style="text-align: left;">Double Time</h3>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">For Double Time poling is done on every skate. Good balance is needed to allow time for the poles to swing back and up again while standing on one ski. A good drill for starting is to put the other ski down parallel after each skate and push.

                <h3 class="heading__aligned--page" style="text-align: left;">Single Time</h3>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">In Single Time poling is done on every second skate, with slightly different timing than for Offset skate . The pole plant should happen just before the weight is transferred to the other ski (same timing as for Double Time). The pole swing should be continuous and rhythmical, like a dance (it’s called “single dance” in Norwegian).

                <p class="left__aligned--p">Free Skate is skating without using the poles.  Swinging the arms naturally helps to generate momentum and promote weight transfer.  As with all skating techniques, you should push off your inside edge, then try to glide with a flat ski.
