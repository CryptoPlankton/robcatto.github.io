                <h3>A great way to improve your skills and agility</h3>
                <p>Ski play can be enjoyed by adults and children. It can be on groomed or ungroomed snow. Courses are sometimes set up at resorts where you can practice going around poles over bumps and under hoops to improve your skills and agility. Alternatively you can set up your own course with your ski poles or make a jump with a ski shovel. On flat groomed areas most school-yard games can also be played on skis - frisbee soccer, tag, other examples. On downhills you can set up slalom courses or a nordic cross (a new event at the Youth Olympics).  Fun for all ages!
