                <h3>What are groomed tracks?</h3>
                <p>Groomed or Track skiing is where the snow has been packed down and smoothed flat by a grooming machine. Tracks can be groomed for skating, with just fine corduroy grooves left by the tiller of the machine, or for classic with two parallel tracks set into the snow for the skis to glide in.

                    <h3>Learn to ski on groomed tracks</h3>
                    <p>Skate skiing is mostly done on groomed tracks, except in “spring conditions” where the snow sets up firm off track and you can skate everywhere. In Australia all the ski resorts have groomed trails, and at some of them a trail fee is required to use the trails. Most skiers learn how to xc ski on groomed tracks, as it is much easier than on unpacked snow. Check out Get Started on how to get out on the groomed ski trails at a resort near you!
