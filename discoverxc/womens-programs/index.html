                <h3>Ski de Femme</h3>
                <p>Ski de Femme is proudly presented at Falls Creek by the Birkebeiner Nordic Ski Club.  This community event has been going since 1989 and  is run by volunteers as a day out on xc skis for women! 
                <p>Ski De Femme offers free cross country skiing instruction in small groups for both novice and intermediate skiers in a choice of classical or skating techniques. The clinics are fun and a great way for women of all abilities to learn and get into cross country skiing.
                <p>Meet in the Nordic Bowl for a lesson and then some fun races (1km/2.5km or 5km) for all abilities.  Enjoy yummy scones and a cup of tea.  And maybe even win a spot prize (kindly donated by local business)!
                <p>It is free to participate in Ski De Femme. Equipment can be hired at Windy Corner from Falls Creek Nordic Hire prior to the clinic.
