                <h3>What is Spring Skiing?</h3>
                <p>“Spring Skiing or Crust Cruising” refers to when you can ski everywhere without breaking through the top layer of snow. This is possible when snow has melted during the day and then refrozen overnight.

                    <h3>Skate anywhere!</h3>
                    <p>The result is a crusty layer, strong enough for skiers to venture on top and perfect for smooth skate skiing. This phenomenon allows skate skiers to travel quickly and easily on open areas and over long distances, covering in the hours what it might take half a day to do on touring skis through deep snow. It also softens up to make for great conditions for telemarking. The trick is to get up early and know when to quit. To the experienced it is an addiction.
