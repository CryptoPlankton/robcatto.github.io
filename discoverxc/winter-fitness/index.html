                <h3>A Low impact Sport</h3>
                <p class="left__aligned--p">The low impact nature of cross country skiing means it can also be great for rehabilitation from injury. Sessions can be designed to focus on upper or lower body workouts. Those with ongoing injuries should consult their doctor or physiotherapist for advice on appropriate activities and whether classic or skating would be most suitable for their circumstances.
