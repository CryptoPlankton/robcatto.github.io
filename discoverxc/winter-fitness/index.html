                <p class="left__aligned--p">When it is cold and dreary off the mountain and you struggle to get out training, you can get out in the pristine white snow for a couple of hours of intense training.  Cross country skiing is great for cross training for all active sports people. There are many benefits including altitude training, endurance training and the fact that it is a whole body workout.  
                <p class="left__aligned--p">Many kayakers, cyclists and rowers use cross country skiing as part of their winter training program.  Keep fit over winter and come try xc skiing.
