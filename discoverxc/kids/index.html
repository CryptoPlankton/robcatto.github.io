                    <h3>Primary school aged kids are the perfect age to learn to ski</h3>
                    <p>Kids in primary school have more stamina and can get a little further but at the same time love to play in the snow.
                        <p>One of the best ways to learn is through games and ski-play. Most playground games can also be played on skis. Kids will pick up balance, coordination and agility skills without thinking by just having fun trying to tag or avoid their friends, or throwing/catching a ball or frisbee.
                         <p>If there’s no-one to play with, take your kids for a ski adventure with a picnic and when you stop let the kids have a play in the fresh snow away from the crowds.  Or let them participate in social racing with kids of their own age.
                 
                    </p>

                <h3>Build their confidence</h3>
                <p>Kids generally start learning on classic skis but can quickly progress to skating skis.  As they build confidence on their skis they will start to explore ungroomed areas on the sides of the tracks and find hills to go up and down. The great thing about cross country skiing is that you can ski wherever you like however consider their skiing ability to ensure they have a safe snow experience. 
                           <p>Many schools close to the snow (and some far from the snow) have annual or regular ski days, but if your school doesn’t have one then there are number of options:
           
                           <p align=left>&#8226; Go with your family or family friends
                           <br>&#8226; Join a ski club/community with a junior program
                           <br>&#8226; Take part in resort-based school holiday programs
                           <br>&#8226; Talk your school into starting a ski program.

                <h3>Ski fun for pre-school kids</h3>
                <p>You are never too young to enjoy cross country skiing.  The whole family can participate! Take your kids for a ski picnic and play in the fresh snow away from the crowds. 
                <p>Kids from age two or three can start learning to ski. Once they are comfortable in the alpine environment their ability to learn fast means that before long they will be skiing better than their parents do!
                <p>For the under 4’s skis are usually strap-on and will fit any shoe, snow-boot or gumboot. If needing to hire skis or snow-boots, it might be wise to ring and check availability of small sizes before heading up the mountain.

                <h3>Tips for pre-school kids</h3>
                        <p align=left>&#8226; Choose your days. Avoid windy and snowy conditions.
                           <br>&#8226; Let them wear skis inside on the carpet to get used to them.                              
                           <br>&#8226; Start on the flat and let them walk around. The gliding will come when they’re ready.
                           <br>&#8226; Be patient. Some days they will just want to play in the snow. And why not!
                           <br>&#8226; Be realistic about how long you can stay out with them.
                           <br>&#8226; Bring snacks and water. Don’t forget sunscreen.
                           <br>&#8226; Remember they will need a waterproof outfit, layers of warm clothing, boots, glasses/goggles to keep warm.

                    <h3>And if you are too young to ski</h3>
                    <p>If too young for ski or if they’re ready for nap, borrow or hire a pulk (a special enclosed sled) and take your baby or toddler for a tour. They really enjoy getting out and you get a great workout at the same time! Some bike trailers (e.g. Chariot) have ski attachments to replace the wheels.
