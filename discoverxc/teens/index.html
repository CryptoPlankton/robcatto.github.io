                <h3>Get social in the great outdoors </h3>
                <p>Cross country skiing is a great skill to learn for teenagers and they will make life-long friends along the way. 
<p>Teenagers who beginners to the sport generally start learning on classic skis in groomed tracks.  Then move to exploring the groomed areas and getting lots of confidence on their skis by exploring the ungroomed areas on the sides of the tracks.  The next step if they are keen is to learn how to skate ski which is more like inline skating.  Lots of fun!
