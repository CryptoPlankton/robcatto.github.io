                                Yes anybody can!  XC skiing is a gentle introduction to skiing.  You do not need to ride lifts or go down steep slopes but it still means you get out into the beautiful alpine environment. You start on the flat or going up gentle hills and you gradually develop your skills.

                                It really depends which resort you ski at as some have trail fees and some do not.   Also most resorts have a day car entry fee and you will need to hire chains for the car.   If you have not equipment (skis/boots & poles) the other cost is for hire.

                        <p>
                                Traditional classic skiing is a forward stride and glide motion similar to walking or running, where each ski is pushed forward alternatively whilst leaving the other ski stationary.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Skate skiing involves pushing forward in a “V’ Stride and pushing alternative skis away from one another at an angle, similar to rollerblading/iceskating.

                                No you don’t have to. However it is easier to learn the classic style and get confident with your balance and agility on on skis before trying skating.

                                No because of the more gentle terrain you will not need to use more than a snowplow in most places to slow you down.

                                Yes children love the combination of snow play and exploring the snowy landscape on skis.  Children from as young as 2 years old can start playing around on skis.  If too young for ski or if they’re ready for nap, borrow or hire a pulk (a special enclosed sled) and you can take your baby or toddler for a tour.

                                Basically you will need skis, poles and boots to get out xc skiing and appropriate clothing/bags for the conditions and distance you are planning to ski.

                                A lot more comfortable and you can easily walk in them!  The standard boot it is a softer more flexible boot than downhill boots - more like a walking/running shoe.

                                Clothing required for xc skiing is different to what is required for downhill skiing.  Layering is more important than warm outer layers because you get warm exercising when cross country skiing.  Depending on how far you are travelling, the weather and what type of skiing you are doing most skiers would have a waterproof jacket, waterproof (or just windproof) overpants, jumper, thermals, beanie, gloves and sunglasses.  It is always better to have an extra layer in a backpack if you are unsure though!

                                Australian xc skiing resorts are in the alpine environment so you need to be prepared for all conditions.  Some days you might be wearing a t-shirt and others you will be rugged up.  If you have the right clothes and lots of layers you will not be cold.

                                XC skis like all skis need to be waxed to glide correctly.  You can either go to a retail xc shop and get them waxed professionally or do it yourself.
