                    <h3>Do I need to qualify?</h3>
                    <p>It is not necessary to qualify for any of the State or National Championship events in Australia, although it is necessary to have hold a race licence for all National and some state events.

                <p>
                    Age categories at Junior Championship events start from U12 and go through to U20 in two-year brackets. At Open Championship events thereâ€™s a special U23 category, after that age categories go up in 10 year increments from U30 to U70, then 70+.
